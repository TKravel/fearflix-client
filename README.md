# FEARFLIX

Fearflix is UI clone based off of Netflix, powered with data consisting of only currently available horror movies on netflix. Built with React hooks, React-Redux, Redux-toolkit, SASS, and Vanilla JavaScript. This is an on going project I plan to continue adding functionality over time.

## Server code

While data is currently hard coded to save on API calls, functionality has been included to call an express.js server which fetches movies from a third party API using redux AsyncThunk.
